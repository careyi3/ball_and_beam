# Mechanics

Here you will find the STL files used to 3d print the main body, beam end caps and shaft coupler for the rig. THe rig I built was printed with PLA.

Aside from the 3d printed parts, there are a few other mechanical parts listed below. Most parts were used off the shelf however I also fabricated some of the parts from 5mm stainless steel rod.

## Assembly

Assembly is straight forward enough for this machine. Firstly, I recommend cleaning up all 3d printed parts to remove excess material. Be careful with this as some parts are designed to be a compression fit, so don't take too much off, just enough so that the parts can slip together.

Firstly, press two of the bearings into their receiving slots in the main body of the machine. Next, place the motor into it's slot and screw it into place using two M3 bolts. Next, attach the small pulley to the motor shaft and tighten via the set screws.

Next, insert the drive shaft into the two fitted bearings and add the larger pulley, again securing with the set screws. Place the belt between the two pulleys. If it is too tight, remove one of the pulleys, attach the belt and then with the belt under tension, place the pulley back on the shaft.

Slot the two remaining bearings with washers either side onto the M5 bolt. Insert this into the slot on the body such that the bearings push against the belt (this is the belt tensioner). Once happy with the position, add the M5 nut and tighten.

Take each end of the beams end caps and using a 5mm metal drill bit, bore out the centres so that they are a snug fit over the 5mm beam arm shafts. Press one end in fully. Take the shaft coupler and pass the closed ring over the furthers bar of the beam arm. Twist the arms so that the lower open jaw of the shaft coupler snaps into place around the bottom shaft.

Finally press the shaft coupler onto the drive shaft.
