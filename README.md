# Ball and Beam

This repo is to record all of the resources that went into making the ball and beam rig that I talk about in [this article](https://iancarey.ie/blog/ballandbeam)

Feel free to browse around and copy from this what you like. Don't hesitate to ask questions! In each folder you will find a README with some details on each subject.
