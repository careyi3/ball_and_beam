# Code

The code for this rig is fairly simple Arduino code. The code was designed to be run on an Arduino Nano but should work fine on an Uno with no alterations.

## Prerequisites

There are two libraries used in this code, one for reading the rotary encoder and another for computing moving averages. These must be installed via the Arduino Library Manager.

[MovingAverage](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/movingaverager/)

[Encoder](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/encoder/)

**NOTE: The [reference website](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html) for this library is fantastic and a great resource if you don't already know how an optical rotary encoder works.**
