# Datasheets

Here you will find data sheets for most of the electronic components used in the build. The only thing I couldn't find a datasheet for was the exact stepper motor I used. I found the stepper in my parts box and have no idea where is came from. However, any 4 wire NEMA17 sized stepper that you can fit with a HEDS 9000/9100 optical encoder should work fine. Also worth noting for the rest of the mechanical components, the stepper had a 5mm diameter shaft.
